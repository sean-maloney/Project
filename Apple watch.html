        <p>Apple is committed to reducing its impact on the environment and has implemented various initiatives to do so.</p>

        <p>One of the company's main goals is to become carbon neutral by 2030, which means that all of its facilities, including offices, retail stores, and data centers, will produce zero net carbon emissions.</p>

        <p>To achieve this, Apple has invested in renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, and has also developed programs to conserve water and reduce waste.</p>

        <p>Additionally, Apple has designed its products with the environment in mind, using recycled materials and designing them for longevity to reduce the need for replacements.</p>

        <p>Through these efforts, Apple is working towards a future in which technology can be developed and used sustainably.</p>
